Greetings! This report is designed to offer insights into my musical preferences in a captivating and engaging manner, utilizing Power BI dashboards with data sourced from Spotify servers. This project provided an excellent opportunity to hone a variety of skills, including data visualization techniques such as glasmorphism, HTML visuals, and DENEB visuals, as well as proficiency in PBI formatting and Python for data enrichment. Additionally, this repository contains the assets utilized throughout the project.

As a bonus, you'll discover an additional visualization in the PBIX file showcasing the most streamed songs on Spotify for the year. In this instance, the data is sourced from the Onyx Data challenge on Spotify's Most Streamed Songs in 2023. [here](https://onyxdata.ck.page/a12261b1fb).
